                                <p>Insurance is intrinsically a mutual concept. However the commoditised approach to insurance
                                    emphasises on the individual insured person as a customer and consumer. It represents
                                    the individualisation of risk amelioration, and the conversion of the insurance policy
                                    as a product. Insurance thus becomes a commodity, to be bought and sold in the market
                                    like other products.
                                </p>
                                <p>Against this background health becomes an interesting risk to cover because of its strong
                                    base in human behaviour and cultural beliefs that puts the design of commercially developed
                                    health insurance products with their primary motive of profit into question.
                                </p>
                                <p>When the context is of the poor, low income groups, this situation is further compounded
                                    as their risks are perceived to be higher and their paying and understanding capacity
                                    to be lower. Thus health with its complexities and insurance with its profit motive make
                                    the paradigm of health micro insurance a challenging task.

                    <div class="text-left">
                        <p>Uplift’s product design is the result of over a decade of working and setting up nine mutuals across
                            urban rural and tribal geographies. The biggest learning that Uplift has had is the fact that
                            members, families, women, need health more than health insurance.</p>
                        <p>Also, in the claims- only design of commercial health insurance companies, out of 1000 members only
                            10-30 members will get claims. The rest 950 odd members get almost nothing. And its not that
                            they don’t have health expenses-paying for OPD, medicines, diagnostics is across most of the
                            families, but they do not benefit from this claims’ only model. The other part of this story
                            is if such Outpatient preventive and promotive services are provided at the point where member
                            stays it serves as a gate keeping mechanism that allows them to take care of their health.</p>
                        <p>Uplift Biradaree’s model caters to the daily health needs of its members as much as hospitalization
                            expense needs.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, Uplift has developed and deployed very strategic health services using its learning
                            and insights coming from its members. The following services form the mutual product design at
                            Uplift Biradaree:</p>

                                as they bring preventive care right to the door step of the members and their families. A
                                family has to spend anywhere between 100-500 Rs on one-time OPD consultations otherwise,
                                which they get as a cashless service.

                                in members being able to get the right information on health care access at the needed moment.

                            <p>Several macro level studies have pointed out that the out of pocket expense in India on health
                                is 70% and out of this 70%, Medicines constitute 70% of this expense known as the 70-70 paradox.
                                Uplift also realized that its member families regardless of hospitalisation were spending
                                huge amounts of their hard-earned money on buying medicines every month without getting the
                                right price and at times quality for it. Uplift as part of its product design provides its
                                members with Medicines on discount using the pharmacy license it has got for this purpose.

                                that contain also a quality charter.However, unlike TPAs it guides its members to the best

                                expenses. Uplift has saved lakhs of rupees of its members, using this health care intelligence

                                Mutual Aid
                            </h3>
                            <p>Uplift’s capacity to offer technically sound Mutual aid is bolstered by the fact that it has
                                technical support from three of the largest mutual insurance companies from Canada Sweden
                                and the Netherlands. In the past its co-founder has been an actuary who actively supports
                                the Uplift team in determining the best that the product can offer. The Uplift product does
                                not have any age-based premiums and age-based exclusions. The contribution is kept the same
                                for everybody to make the product inclusive. However, this is only possible when families
                                join in groups to avoid any mis-selection.The product features contribution, cover, exclusions
                                etc have to be validated by the community before the on boarding process begins.
